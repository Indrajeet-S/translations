# Original: The Linux Distribution Chooser tries to help new users to get an overview about suitable distributions. The service only offers Distributions which are suitable to the answers you give. If the answers where too unrealistic, the Distribution Chooser may offer no result. 
</br>
The old Linux Distribution Chooser calculates a different result and lists the distributions with an approximate result. </br>
</br>
This service should help to give an overview for beginners in Linux. It is possible that this service returns not 100 % suitable results when your answers exceed a realistic complexity limit.

# Original: Arch Linux (or Arch /ˈɑrtʃ/) is a Linux-based operating system for i686 and x86-64 computers. It is composed predominantly of free and open source software, and supports community involvement.  The design approach of the development team focuses on elegance, code correctness, minimalism, and simplicity, and expects the user to be willing to make some effort to understand the system's operation. A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, pacman, is used to install, remove and update software packages.  Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components.

# Original: Ubuntu (/uːˈbuːntuː/ oo-boon-too) is a Debian-based Linux operating system, with Unity as its default desktop environment (GNOME was the previous desktop environment). It is based on free software and named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, "human-ness"), which often is translated as "humanity towards others" or "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".  According to some metrics, Ubuntu is the most popular desktop Linux distribution to date. See Installed base section.  Development of Ubuntu is led by Canonical Ltd., a company owned by South African entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of technical support and other services related to Ubuntu. The Ubuntu project is publicly committed to the principles of open source development; people are encouraged to use free software, study how it works, improve upon it, and distribute it.

# Original: Linux Mint is a 32- and 64-bit Linux distribution for desktop computers, based on either Ubuntu or Debian. Its stated aim is to be a "modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use." Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software such as Adobe Flash. Mint's motto is "from freedom came elegance".  New versions of Linux Mint have been released approximately every six months. The first release, named "Ada", was released in 2006. The 17th release, "Qiana", was released on May 31, 2014. Support for older releases usually ends shortly after the next version is released, but there have been releases with long-term support, with v17.x supported for five years, ending in April 2019.

# Original: Debian (/ˈdɛbiən/) is an operating system which is composed primarily of free software, most of which is under the GNU General Public License, and developed by a group of individuals known as the Debian project. Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal computers and network servers, and has been used as a base for several other Linux distributions.  Debian was first announced in 1993 by Ian Murdock, and the first stable release was made in 1996. The development is carried out over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by a project leader and three foundational documents. New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze.  As one of the earliest Linux distributions, it was envisioned that Debian was to be developed openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU. This vision drew the attention and support of the Free Software Foundation, which sponsored the project for the first part of its life.

After Novell acquired SUSE Linux in January 2004,[4] Novell decided to release the SUSE Linux Professional product as a 100% open source project.[5] In 2011 The Attachmate Group acquired Novell and split Novell and SUSE into two autonomous subsidiary companies. SUSE offers products and services around SUSE Linux Enterprise—their commercial offering that is based on openSUSE Linux.  The initial release of the community project was a beta version of SUSE Linux 10.0, and as of November 19, 2013 the current stable release is openSUSE 13.1.

# Original: elementary OS is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. It makes use of a desktop with its own shell named Pantheon, and is deeply integrated with other elementary OS applications like Plank (a dock), Midori (the default web browser) and Scratch (a simple text editor). This distribution uses Gala as its window manager, which is based on Mutter.  The distribution initially started as a set of themes and applications designed for Ubuntu which later turned into its own Linux distro. Being Ubuntu-based, it is compatible with its repositories and packages. It uses Ubuntu's own software center to handle installation/removal of software, though its own software center is in the making. Its user interface aims at being intuitive for new users without consuming too many resources.

# Original: CentOS (abbreviated from Community Enterprise Operating System) is a Linux distribution that attempts to provide a free, enterprise-class, community-supported computing platform which aims to be 100% binary compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). In January 2014, it was announced that CentOS was officially joining forces with Red Hat while staying independent from RHEL, under a new CentOS Governing Board.  The first CentOS release in May 2004, numbered as CentOS version 2, was forked from RHEL version 2.1AS.[1] As of versions 5.10 and 6.5, CentOS officially supports x86-64 and x86 architectures (with Physical Address Extension (PAE) required for the latter), while a beta release is expected to be available for the PowerPC architecture.

# Original: Puppy Linux operating system is a lightweight Linux distribution that focuses on ease of use and minimal memory footprint. The entire system can be run from RAM with current versions generally taking up about 130 MB, allowing the boot medium to be removed after the operating system has started. Applications such as AbiWord (word documents), Gnumeric (spreadsheets) and MPlayer (multimedia player) are included, along with a choice of lightweight web browsers. The distribution was originally developed by Barry Kauler and other members of the community. The tool Woof can build a Puppy Linux distribution from the binary packages of other Linux distributions.

# Original: Knoppix, or KNOPPIX (/knɒpɪks/ knop-iks),[2] is an operating system based on Debian designed to be run directly from a CD / DVD (Live CD) or a USB flash drive (Live USB), one of the first of its kind for any operating system. Knoppix was developed by Linux consultant Klaus Knopper. When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a RAM drive. The decompression is transparent and on-the-fly.  Although Knoppix is primarily designed to be used as a Live CD, it can also be installed on a hard disk like a typical operating system. Computers that support booting from USB devices can load Knoppix from a live USB flash drive or memory card.  There are two main editions of Knoppix: the traditional Compact Disc (700 megabytes) edition and the DVD (4.7 gigabytes) "Maxi" edition. Each of these main editions have two language-specific editions: English and German.

# Original: Gentoo Linux (/ˈdʒɛntuː/ jen-too[2]) is a computer operating system based on the Linux kernel and built using the Portage package management system. It is distributed as free and open source software. Unlike a binary software distribution, the source code is compiled locally according to the user's preferences and is often optimized for the specific type of computer. Precompiled binaries are available for some very large packages and for packages whose source code has not been released.  The "Gentoo" name comes from the fast-swimming Gentoo penguin. It was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimization. Gentoo package management is designed to be modular, portable, easy to maintain, and flexible. Gentoo is sometimes described as a meta-distribution, "because of its near-unlimited adaptability", in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to themselves.

# Original: Antergos (previously known as Cinnarch) is a Linux distribution of Galician origin based on the Arch Linux operating system.
