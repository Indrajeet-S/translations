# Distrochooser translations

You want to support the [distrochooser](https://distrochooser.de)? You can create a translation in your language!

## Current languages

- German
- English
- Dutch (in progress)

## Syntax

The *.csv files containing a dump of the database.  The file has mostly the structure
`DBIndex;LanguageKey;Value`.

You can replace the english translation values with your translation. I will merge the new translation as a new one into the database. Please keep the `DBIndex` and other index columns.

To get the translation merged, please open a pull request with a description of your translation to tell me, what language it is and which 2-char language code I should use for it.

Please also add the new language to the list in this readme.

# Thank you :)
