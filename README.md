![https://distrochooser.de/assets/tux.png](https://distrochooser.de/assets/tux.png)

You want to support the [distrochooser](https://distrochooser.de)? You can create a translation in your language!

The translation is in gettext format (`.po`) which can be edited with any Gettext-Editor (e. g. Poedit).

Just look into the sample folder `/en`. Please create a new folder named `$languagecode` and put the `distrochooser.po` file in it. Happy translating!

2 Strings, `welcomeText` and `aboutText` are HTML-templates. Just copy the markdown and Replace the human-readable parts.

## Current languages

- de 
- en (see `/en/`)

# Contributors

(you will be added to the list when your translation is finished)

# Thank you!
