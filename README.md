# Distrochooser translations

![https://distrochooser.de/assets/tux.png](https://distrochooser.de/assets/tux.png)

You want to support the [distrochooser](https://distrochooser.de)? You can create a translation in your language!

The translation is in gettext format (`.po`) which can be edited with any Gettext-Editor (e. g. Poedit).

If you want to start a new translation, just copy a existing folder. Don't forget to rename it to the new language code (e. g. de_DE for german) and to change the header field in the `.po` file.

## Remarks

- Please re-use HTML if present
- One string construct is build by several strings to get 'A $foo-User thinks'. You can ignore this value if you are getting trouble with this

## Current languages

- de is developer's native language and is not listed in this repo
- en will be translated by me

## Language wishlist

- fr
- it
- es
- ru
- add more :)
