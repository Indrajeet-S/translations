# Distrochooser translations

![https://distrochooser.de/assets/tux.png](https://distrochooser.de/assets/tux.png)

You want to support the [distrochooser](https://distrochooser.de)? You can create a translation in your language!

The translation is in gettext format (`.po`) which can be edited with any Gettext-Editor (e. g. Poedit).

The folder `/en/` contains the an empty gettext-file (`*.po`), listing the values with the original english strings. You can copy this folder and rename it into an two-letter [ISO639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1)-Code, e. g. "fr" for french. 

## Remarks

- 2 Strings, `welcomeText` and `aboutText` are HTML-templates. Just copy the markdown and Replace the human-readable parts
- One string construct is build by several strings to get 'A $foo-User thinks'. You can ignore this value if you are getting trouble with this

## Current languages
